# Project state

Written for someone opening this repository with no prior context. It describes
what is real, what is scaffolding, why things are the way they are, and what is
still unresolved.

Last updated: 2026-08-11
Branch: `claude/civic-map-entry-screen-4ey1cs`

---

## 1. What this is

**We the People** is a civic app. Today it contains exactly one screen: the map
you land on.

A reader enters a five-digit zip code. The map flies there and renders upcoming
local government meetings — city council, county boards, school districts — as
pins. Clicking a pin shows who is meeting, when, where, and links the agenda.

That is the entire product surface right now. There are no accounts, no
persistence, and no live data.

### Running it

```bash
corepack pnpm install
cp .env.example .env.local     # optional — see §2
corepack pnpm dev
```

Then http://localhost:3000.

**Use `corepack pnpm`, not bare `pnpm`.** `package.json` pins
`"packageManager": "pnpm@10.33.0"`. If a machine has a different global pnpm and
`manage-package-manager-versions` is off, bare `pnpm` silently runs the wrong
version. Corepack honours the pin. Node has no `engines` constraint; Node 24
works.

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `corepack pnpm dev` | Development server |
| `corepack pnpm build` | Production build |
| `corepack pnpm test` | `node --test` over `tests/` — 14 tests |
| `corepack pnpm lint` | ESLint |
| `corepack pnpm ingest mock` | Run one source adapter end to end |
| `corepack pnpm zcta:fetch` | Rebuild zip centroids from Census (see §3.2) |
| `corepack pnpm db:generate` / `db:migrate` | Drizzle migrations |

## 2. What exists and works

All of the following is implemented, passing lint and typecheck, covered by a
green production build, and confirmed rendering in a browser.

### Request path

```
app/page.tsx
  └── components/map/map-entry.tsx        owns all shared screen state
        ├── components/map/map-canvas.tsx  the MapLibre instance and markers
        ├── components/map/entry-notice.tsx / location-bar.tsx / zip-comb.tsx
        ├── components/map/coverage-notice.tsx
        └── components/map/meeting-panel.tsx
                    │
                    └── GET /api/meetings?lat=&lng=&radiusKm=
                             └── lib/meetings/query.ts   the cascade
                                   └── lib/meetings/registry.ts
                                         └── lib/sources/mock/
```

`app/api/meetings/route.ts` is the map's **only** data dependency. It validates
latitude and longitude ranges, clamps `radiusKm` to the widest ladder rung, and
returns the search result verbatim.

### The empty-state cascade — `lib/meetings/query.ts`

The single most important piece of product logic. An empty map reads as "your
government does nothing" when the truth is usually "nothing within fifteen miles
this fortnight." So the search steps outward:

1. **`exact`** — upcoming meetings within the requested radius (default 25 km).
2. **`widened`** — nothing there, so it tries 60 km, then 150 km.
3. **`concluded`** — no upcoming meetings at any radius; falls back to meetings
   concluded in the last 30 days, rendered visually distinct.
4. **`none`** — nothing either way. Says so plainly.

Which rung produced the result is returned to the client as `tier` and shown on
screen by `coverage-notice.tsx`. This is deliberate: *a search that quietly
widened its radius is indistinguishable from one that found what you asked for,
which makes it a wrong answer.*

Upcoming reaches 60 days ahead; the concluded tier reaches 30 days back. One
upstream fetch happens at the widest radius and the rungs filter over it, so a
real adapter is not asked for the same window three times.

### Other working pieces

- **`lib/meetings/venues.ts`** — groups meetings by rounded coordinate (4 dp,
  about 11 m) so a chamber hosting four sittings is *one* pin, not four stacked
  unclickable markers.
- **`lib/geo/zcta.ts`** — zip validation and lookup. Distinguishes three failure
  modes (`malformed`, `unknown`, `uncovered`) so each can get an honest message.
- **`lib/geo/distance.ts`** — haversine.
- **`lib/time/zoned.ts`** — reassembles a local calendar date plus wall-clock
  time into a correct instant for an IANA zone. Covered by tests including DST
  boundary crossings.
- **`hooks/use-stored-zip.ts`** — remembers the zip in `localStorage` under
  `wtp.approximate_location`, read through `useSyncExternalStore` so the server
  renders a `pending` state and a returning reader never sees the entry notice
  flash before their zip loads. Survives private mode and disabled storage.
- **`lib/db/index.ts`** — lazily constructed Neon/Drizzle client.
- **Tests** — `tests/cascade.test.ts`, `tests/zoned.test.ts`, `tests/districts.test.ts`,
  26 total.

### The congressional district overlay

A toggleable national boundary layer for the 119th Congress, off by default.

- **`scripts/fetch-districts.ts`** (`pnpm districts:fetch`) downloads the Census
  cartographic boundary file, converts it to GeoJSON, builds an OCD-ID per
  feature, simplifies, and writes `public/geo/cd119.geojson` — 441 features,
  1.55 MB (0.45 MB gzipped). The output is committed, the way
  `zcta-centroids.json` is.
- **`lib/ocd/fips.ts`** holds the FIPS-to-postal table as an explicit literal and
  builds the identifier. It is never derived from a name field.
- **`lib/map/districts.ts`** owns the source and the two layers: a dashed line
  and a label. Both are inserted before the first symbol layer so basemap place
  names stay on top.
- **`hooks/use-district-layer.ts`** persists the toggle under
  `wtp.show_districts`, using the same `useSyncExternalStore` pattern as
  `use-stored-zip.ts` so the layer never flashes during hydration.
- **`components/map/district-toggle.tsx`** is the control. If the boundary file
  fails to load it disables itself and says so, rather than leaving the switch
  on with nothing drawn.

**Only four properties per feature** — `ocdId`, `state`, `district`, `label`.
Everything else Census ships is dropped.

**No officeholder, candidate, or party data is rendered on these boundaries,**
and none should be added until a sourced officeholder dataset exists. CLAUDE.md
line 17 forbids rendering a position or a person without a source record; a name
on a district line would be inference from nothing. If adding one ever feels
like an obvious improvement, that is the failure mode the rule exists to catch.

## 3. What is stubbed or mocked

### 3.1 Meeting data — the mock source

**Where:** `lib/sources/mock/` (adapter + 32 fixtures)

Meetings are fake. **The interface around them is not.**

`lib/sources/types.ts` defines the real contract — `MeetingSource` with
`fetch()`, `normalize()`, `upsert()`, and a `Meeting` record carrying an OCD-ID
and full provenance. The mock emits **Legistar-shaped** rows (separate
`EventDate` and `EventTime` strings with no zone attached, exactly as Granicus
Legistar returns them) and transforms them precisely as a real adapter will.
Nothing above `lib/meetings/registry.ts` can tell the difference.

Fixture coverage — **34 events**, of which 6 are in the past and 2 are canceled.
Philadelphia was removed 2026-08-11 and replaced with the jurisdictions covering
two real test zips, 07866 and 03255:

| Jurisdiction | Zip | Events |
|---|---|---|
| Tucson, AZ | 85701 | 10 |
| Rockaway Township, NJ | 07866 | 4 |
| Pima County, AZ | 85701 | 3 |
| Newbury, NH | 03255 | 3 |
| Tucson Unified School District, AZ | 85701 | 2 |
| Morris County, NJ | 07866 | 2 |
| Rockaway Township School District, NJ | 07866 | 2 |
| Kearsarge Regional School District, NH | 03255 | 2 |
| Merrimack County, NH | 03255 | 1 |
| Oro Valley / Marana, AZ | — | 1 each |
| Cochise County / Douglas / Sierra Vista, AZ | — | 1 each |

Two time zones are represented: `America/Phoenix`, which never observes DST, and
`America/New_York`, which crosses it twice a year. That pairing is what catches
a naive offset assumption in the transform.

Merrimack County meets in Boscawen, ~29 km from the 03255 internal point, so it
sits outside the first rung of the radius ladder deliberately — it gives a real
zip a reason to exercise the widened tier.

Fixture dates are **day offsets from today**, resolved at fetch time against the
division's own time zone, so the calendar never goes stale.

**To replace with a real source:**

1. Add a directory under `lib/sources/<name>/` exporting a `MeetingSource`.
2. Change the one `active = resolve(...)` line in `lib/meetings/registry.ts`.
3. Add an entry to the `SOURCES` map in `scripts/ingest.ts`.

That is the whole swap for *reading*. **Writing is not solved** — see §3.3. The
mock's `upsert()` deliberately does nothing and reports every record as
"updated", because persisting fixtures would put fake public meetings into the
same table real ones will land in.

### 3.2 Zip centroids — no longer a stub

**Where:** `lib/geo/zcta-centroids.json`

**Resolved 2026-08-11.** `pnpm zcta:fetch` has been run: the file now holds all
**33,144** ZCTA internal points from the Census 2020 Gazetteer and `complete` is
`true`.

The flag is load-bearing. While it was `false` the app could not claim a zip
*doesn't exist*, only that it didn't have it yet, so `resolveZip()` returned
`uncovered`. With a complete table an unrecognized five-digit zip now correctly
reads as `unknown`.

Rerun `pnpm zcta:fetch` when Census publishes a new vintage.

### 3.3 The database

**Where:** `lib/db/schema.ts` — intentionally empty (`export {}`).

Nothing on the entry screen reads Postgres. `getDb()` is lazy specifically so a
missing `DATABASE_URL` does not break `pnpm dev`; the first caller that actually
needs a connection is the one that gets the error.

**A real meeting source needs this solved first:** tables, a generated migration
(`pnpm db:generate`, never hand-written SQL), and an upsert strategy keyed on
the source-namespaced `Meeting.id`. When meetings get a table, **`ocdId` is the
join key** — never `jurisdiction` or `bodyName` strings.

### 3.4 The districts-and-officeholders rung

Referenced in `query.ts` as the rung that should come after `none`: show
district boundaries with the people who hold those offices, so the answer is
never truly empty. **Not built.** Needs TIGER/Line geometry plus an officeholder
data source, neither of which exists in the repo.

### 3.5 `CLAUDE.md` — restored, but was clobbered once

`CLAUDE.md` (~9.4 KB) holds the product's non-negotiable constraints. On
2026-08-11 it was found containing only the 12-byte line `@AGENTS.md` and was
restored from the author's copy.

The likely cause is Next.js scaffolding: `next dev` generates and re-adds
`AGENTS.md` (see `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`)
and appears to have overwritten `CLAUDE.md` with a pointer to it.

**If `CLAUDE.md` is ever tiny or is just `@AGENTS.md`, it has been overwritten.**
Do not treat the repo as constraint-free and do not reconstruct the file from
memory — restore it. It is mirrored to `G:\My Drive\we-the-people\` partly as a
hedge against this.

`docs/abuse-policy.md` (7.4 KB), referenced by CLAUDE.md line 55, is present. It
is a draft pending review by counsel. It references
`docs/escalation-contacts.md`, which does **not** exist yet.

## 4. Decisions and the reasoning behind them

These are design commitments visible in the code. They are recorded here because
the reasoning is not obvious from the types alone.

**OCD-IDs are the only join key.** `ocd-division/country:us/state:az/place:tucson`
rather than "Tucson". Names collide across states and change between sources.
`Meeting.jurisdiction` exists **for display only**.

**Provenance rides on every record and is never dropped in a transform.** Every
`Meeting` carries `sourceUrl`, `sourceOrg`, `collectedAt`, and `verifiedAt`. When
a field cannot be filled it is `null` and the UI says so — it is never inferred.
The mock sets `verifiedAt: null` because nothing has confirmed fixtures against
a live source; that is the honest value, not an oversight.

**A zip code is orientation, not identity.** A ZCTA is a statistical shape built
from mail delivery routes; it runs straight through cities, counties, school
districts, and legislative lines. It tells the map where to look and nothing
else. Anything needing real districts must ask for a street address and explain
why at the point of asking. The stored-location key is literally named
`approximate_location`.

**The cascade always reports which rung it landed on.** See §2.

**Unplaceable records are dropped, never guessed.** `normalize()` discards any
event it cannot pin in time or space. A wrong date on a public hearing is worse
than a missing one.

**Pins are venues, not meetings.** See §2.

**`normalize(raw, now)` takes the clock as a parameter** rather than calling
`Date.now()`, so the transform is deterministic and testable. Status
(`SCHEDULED` / `CONCLUDED`) is derived from that parameter.

**The stored zip is re-resolved on read**, not trusted from storage. A Census
vintage update moves centroids; the zip string is the only durable part.

**`CANCELED` meetings are kept but never used to fill an empty map.** A canceled
meeting is itself news; padding a sparse map with one would be misleading.

**Field naming: camelCase in TypeScript, snake_case in Postgres, mapped at the
Drizzle boundary.** Settled 2026-08-11. CLAUDE.md writes provenance fields as
`source_url` / `source_org` / `collected_at` / `verified_at`; `lib/sources/types.ts`
declares them as `sourceUrl` / `sourceOrg` / `collectedAt` / `verifiedAt`. Both
are correct for where they live. The translation happens in one place — the
Drizzle table definitions, which name the column explicitly:

```ts
sourceUrl: text("source_url").notNull(),
collectedAt: timestamp("collected_at", { withTimezone: true }).notNull(),
verifiedAt: timestamp("verified_at", { withTimezone: true }),
```

No snake_case reaches application code, and no camelCase reaches SQL. There is
currently no table to demonstrate this on (`lib/db/schema.ts` is empty) — the
convention is recorded here so it does not get decided ad hoc when meetings get
one.

**District boundaries use the Census *cartographic* file, not TIGER/Line.**
CLAUDE.md line 31 names TIGER/Line. `cb_2025_us_cd119_500k` is the same source
and the same geography generalized to 1:500,000; full-resolution TIGER/Line is
roughly an order of magnitude heavier and is built for spatial joins, not for
shipping to a browser. At 1:500,000 the file is 1.55 MB after simplification;
the equivalent TIGER/Line pull would be tens of MB before it. When district
*resolution* is needed — deciding which district an address falls in, which is
tracker item M02 — that is a server-side job against full-resolution geometry,
and this file is not it.

**GENZ2025, not GENZ2024.** Both carry the 119th Congress; 2025 is the current
vintage (`https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/` lists GENZ2010 through GENZ2025).

**Every congressional seat is `<jurisdiction>/cd:<number|at-large>`.** Verified
2026-08-11 against the canonical published list,
`opencivicdata/ocd-division-ids`, `identifiers/country-us.csv` (194,977
identifiers) — a one-time check of the convention itself, not a runtime
dependency, and deliberately not added as a source.

| Case | Identifier |
|---|---|
| Ordinary district | `state:az/cd:7` |
| At-large state | `state:wy/cd:at-large` |
| DC delegate | `district:dc/cd:at-large` |
| Territory delegate | `territory:pr/cd:at-large` |

Three corrections came out of that check. At-large is **`cd:at-large`**, not
`cd:1` — `state:wy/cd:1` and `state:wy/cd:0` do not appear in the list at all.
And DC and the territories do carry a `cd:` segment: bare `district:dc` and
`territory:pr` are real identifiers, but they name the **jurisdiction**, not the
seat inside it, so using them for a district boundary would join a shape to the
wrong class of entity. 12 features are at-large — 6 states, DC, and 5
territories.

**Simplification is topology-safe by construction.** Vertices are quantized to a
4-decimal grid, then a vertex is removed only if *every* ring containing it
votes to drop it. A district can therefore never shed a point its neighbour
keeps, which is the only way a sliver opens along a shared border. The script
asserts this and refuses to write if any shared vertex survives on one side
only. Tolerance is 0.0018° (~200 m): the highest-fidelity setting that stays
under the 2 MB budget. Counter-intuitively, larger tolerances produce *bigger*
files, because they trip the veto that protects rings from collapsing.

**No silent basemap substitution.** When the basemap cannot render, the map
shows the ground colour and the "Basemap unavailable" notice. It never falls
back to a different tile provider. A silent swap is what made a total vector
rendering failure read as a dark style choice for hours on 2026-08-11 — the
symptom of "no data at all" and "this style is very dark" look identical.
A CARTO fallback added during that investigation was removed for this reason,
and because CLAUDE.md line 138 requires asking before adding an external source.

**Marker elements are real `<button>`s** with `aria-label`s, built imperatively
and styled from `app/globals.css`. MapLibre will happily mount an unfocusable
`div` and leave the map unusable without a mouse.

### 4.1 Basemap decisions (2026-08-11)

**The basemap renders from raster tiles, not vector tiles.** Set by
`NEXT_PUBLIC_MAP_RASTER=1`, implemented in `buildRasterStyle()` in
`lib/map/style.ts`.

This is a **workaround, not a preference**, and it contradicts CLAUDE.md line
12 ("MapLibre GL with a vector tile provider"). It must not ship. See §5.1 for
the root cause, which is now understood.

**A useful diagnostic, learned the hard way:** if the basemap is a single flat
colour with **no internal edges anywhere** — no coastline, no land/water
boundary — then no vector data is rendering, regardless of which style is
selected. A correctly rendering dark style always shows a land/water edge.

**Style is `basic-v2-dark`**, set in `.env.local`. Chosen over nine other dark
styles available on the account, measured directly from their style documents:

- Its road network is **one flat `#454545` at 0% saturation** — no coloured road
  hierarchy, nothing to compete with the amber meeting pins.
- **No POI icons or labels at all.**
- Detail labels are held back until **zoom 10**, just under the app's
  `METRO_ZOOM` of 11 — quiet at continental view, legible once someone lands on
  their zip.
- The amber pin (`--signal`, `#ffb000`) is **7.1× brighter** than the brightest
  thing the basemap draws.

Its one high-saturation colour (`Sand`, `#182405`, 77% saturation) is at 8%
lightness — a near-black olive, about 37× dimmer than the pins. It appears
around Tucson from z8 as texture, not colour.

The code default remains `dataviz-dark` (`lib/map/style.ts`), matching the
branch author's intent; `.env.local` overrides it.

## 5. Open questions

### 5.1 Vector tiles — root cause found, fix not yet chosen

**Diagnosed 2026-08-11 in a production build.** This is a packaging bug between
`maplibre-gl@6.3.0` and Turbopack. It affects **dev and production equally** —
the earlier "probably dev-only / React Strict Mode" theory is wrong and is
retracted.

The chain:

1. `maplibre-gl-worker.mjs` (18.2 KB) is **not self-contained**. Its first
   statement is `import{…}from"./maplibre-gl-shared.mjs"` — the 470 KB module
   holding MapLibre's shared internals.
2. Turbopack copies the worker into `/_next/static/media/` **byte-for-byte**
   (verified by file hash), treating it as a static asset rather than a module.
   The literal specifier `./maplibre-gl-shared.mjs` is never rewritten.
3. Turbopack *does* emit the sibling — but content-hashed, as
   `maplibre-gl-shared.<hash>.mjs`.
4. So the worker requests an unhashed `./maplibre-gl-shared.mjs`, which **404s**.
   Module evaluation fails; the Worker fires an `error` event with an empty
   message, which MapLibre does not surface anywhere.
5. **In MapLibre, vector tiles are fetched from inside the worker.** With the
   worker dead, zero `.pbf` requests are ever made. Confirmed by resource
   timing: `style.json` ✅, `tiles.json` ✅, `sprite.json`/`sprite.png` ✅,
   `.pbf` **0**.

Everything downstream follows: `tilesLoaded=false` forever, no `load` event,
`renderedFeatures=0`, and only the background layer painting.

Two earlier "fixes" were both wrong about the cause and neither helped:

- `setWorkerUrl("/maplibre-gl-worker.mjs")` + vendoring the worker into
  `public/` — this replaced a 404 on the *worker* with a 404 on the worker's
  *dependency*, since only the one file was copied. Same symptom, different
  line.
- `prewarm()` for the Strict Mode double-mount — a real concern, but not this.

Candidate fixes, cheapest first:

1. **Vendor both files** into `public/` (`maplibre-gl-worker.mjs` +
   `maplibre-gl-shared.mjs`, ~489 KB) so the relative import resolves. Works
   without touching the build, but pins two minified files that drift on every
   `maplibre-gl` upgrade.
2. **Pre-bundle the worker** into one self-contained file (esbuild, as a build
   step) and point `setWorkerUrl` at it. Cleaner; adds a build step.
3. **Downgrade to `maplibre-gl` 5.x**, which inlines the worker as a blob and
   has no sibling-import problem. Costs an API migration — v6 dropped the
   default export and `map-canvas.tsx` is written against v6 named imports.
4. **Report upstream.** This is arguably Turbopack's bug (raw-copying an `.mjs`
   asset containing unrewritten relative imports) and arguably MapLibre's
   (shipping a worker entry that is not self-contained). Either way it will hit
   every Next 16 + maplibre-gl 6 project.

Not yet decided. Until one lands, `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAP_RASTER=1` is the unblock.

### 5.2 Everything else

1. **Which real meeting source lands first?** `types.ts` names both Granicus
   Legistar and Democracy Works. The mock is Legistar-shaped, which implies
   Legistar, but nothing commits to it.
4. **What is the persistence design?** `upsert()` exists on the interface and
   does nothing in the mock. Tables, migration, and conflict strategy are all
   unspecified. This blocks any real source.
5. **Where are the actual product constraints?** See §3.5 — README and code both
   cite a CLAUDE.md that has no content in this repo.
6. **Should road labels be toned down?** At z14+ `basic-v2-dark` draws road
   labels at `#c2c2c2` (luminance 0.538), marginally *brighter* than the amber
   pins (0.523). They are absent at metro zoom, so this only matters if readers
   routinely zoom in three levels.
7. **When does the districts/officeholders rung get built,** and from which
   geometry and officeholder sources?

---

## 6. Known rough edges

**`CLAUDE.md` is fragile.** See §3.5 — it was clobbered once by Next
scaffolding and restored.

**README describes the pre-workaround behaviour.** It documents vector tiles and
an OpenFreeMap keyless fallback. Under `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAP_RASTER=1` the app draws
raster tiles and, with no key, renders nothing but the ground colour plus a
"Basemap unavailable" notice — OpenFreeMap is vector-only and cannot serve the
raster path. The README's environment table is accurate about the variables but
not about runtime behaviour. `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAP_RASTER` is documented in
`.env.local` but **not** in `.env.example`.

**The vector path still has `resolveBasemap()`'s OpenFreeMap fallback.** That
predates the current work and is the branch author's decision, so it was left
alone — but it is a silent substitution of the kind §4 now rules out, and it
should probably be reconsidered when vector rendering is fixed.

**`public/maplibre-gl-worker.mjs` is a vendored copy** of a file from
`node_modules`. It can drift silently if `maplibre-gl` is upgraded. `public/**`
is excluded from ESLint (`eslint.config.mjs`) purely because this minified file
otherwise produced 44 warnings.

**The map error handler swallows unrecognized errors.** In `map-canvas.tsx`:

```js
if (!/style|sprite|glyphs|tile/i.test(message)) return;
```

Any MapLibre error whose message does not contain one of those four words is
discarded silently — including plain network failures, which typically report as
`"Failed to fetch"`. A silent failure mode is worse than a loud one, and this
materially slowed diagnosis of the vector tile problem.

**`pnpm-lock.yaml` carries pre-existing specifier drift.** Three entries
(`dotenv`, `drizzle-kit`, `tsx`) record different version *ranges* than
`package.json` declares. Resolved versions are identical, so nothing is
functionally wrong, but `pnpm install` rewrites those three lines and they show
up as an uncommitted change. This predates the current work.

**Coverage is 27 zips.** Most zips a real reader enters will report as not
covered until `zcta:fetch` runs. Correct behaviour, surprising first impression.

**No tests cover the map layer.** The 14 tests exercise the cascade and time
handling. Nothing tests marker reconciliation, the camera logic, or basemap
resolution — which is part of why the tile problem was found by eye rather than
by suite.

---

## 7. Current working tree

Uncommitted changes against the branch, all related to the basemap workaround:

```
 M components/map/map-canvas.tsx    setWorkerUrl + prewarm + raster branch
 M lib/map/style.ts                 buildRasterStyle() + rasterBasemapEnabled()
 M eslint.config.mjs                ignore public/
 M pnpm-lock.yaml                   pre-existing specifier drift (see §6)
?? public/maplibre-gl-worker.mjs    vendored worker
?? docs/state.md                    this file
```

`.env.local` is gitignored and holds the MapTiler key,
`NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPTILER_STYLE=basic-v2-dark`, and `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAP_RASTER=1`.
