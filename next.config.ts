   * The build's own identity, inlined at BUILD time — the fix for a premise
   * that turned out to be false (R22, corrected 2026-08-17).
   *
   * `app/api/build/route.ts` read `process.env.COMMIT_REF` at module scope on
   * the stated understanding that Next inlines a statically-visible env
   * reference into the server bundle. It does not: server code keeps the
   * reference as a RUNTIME read, and the built chunk was checked and still
   * contains the literal text `process.env.COMMIT_REF??null`. Netlify sets
   * COMMIT_REF in the BUILD environment and not in the function runtime, so
   * the endpoint read undefined on every request and answered "unknown"
   * forever — which is precisely the quiet failure its own header warned
   * about, arriving through the other door.
   *
   * `env` here is the mechanism that actually inlines: Next substitutes these
   * into the bundle at build. The values are build metadata only — a SHA, a
   * branch name, a deploy context — and never a secret, because anything
   * inlined here is readable by anyone who can read the bundle.
   *
   * Empty string, not "unknown": the route decides how absence renders, and a
   * config that invents a display value would be putting the render default
   * where nobody looks for it.
